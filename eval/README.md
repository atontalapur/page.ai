# eval

Scenario self-test (#6) and, later, the eval runner and results for the 30-bug
evaluation (#15, #16). See [scenarios/README.md](../scenarios/README.md) for the scenario
format.

- `src/scenario.ts` loads a scenario directory and validates its `meta.json`.
- `src/selftest.ts` runs the clean / broken / fixed check: in a sandbox for a code
  scenario (Tier 1 and 2), and on the host against a live demo app for an ops scenario
  (Tier 3).
- `scripts/selftest.ts` is the CLI behind `pnpm scenarios:selftest`. Ops scenarios need
  `DEMO_APP_URL` and `OPS_SECRET`; without them they are skipped when no ids are named,
  and fail when they are.
- `split.json` is the dev / held-out split for the evaluation (#16): 20 dev, 10 held
  out, even by class. It was committed before any tuning. Tuning looks only at the dev
  set; the held-out bugs run once, after the escalation threshold is frozen.
  `src/split.test.ts` checks that every scenario is in one set and that the held-out ones
  follow from the seed, so nobody hand-picked them.
